EchoSOS: A Compact Bluetooth Emergency Beacon for Personal Safety
üöÄ Overview
EchoSOS is an advanced emergency alert system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to provide a low-cost, reliable, and network-independent emergency communication solution. This system is ideal for personal safety and enables discreet, efficient, and rapid emergency alerts.

üì¢ Key Features
Discreet Activation: Trigger the SOS beacon with a simple button press.
Network-Independent: Works even without an active network connection.
Decentralized Transmission: BLE signals hop through nearby devices to reach responders.
Low Power Consumption: Long-lasting battery life, up to 2 years without charging.
Forensic Support: Tracks location data, device IPs, and beacon IDs for investigations.
üîç How It Works
Activation: User presses the emergency button on the BLE beacon.
Signal Broadcasting: The beacon continuously emits BLE signals.
Signal Relay: Nearby mobile devices detect the signal and:
Direct Transmission: Forward location data to the emergency server.
Relay Mode: Devices relay the signal if no network is available until it reaches a connected device.
Emergency Response: The server identifies the emergency location and dispatches help.
